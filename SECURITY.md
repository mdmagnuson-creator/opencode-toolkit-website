# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Report potential vulnerabilities by opening a GitHub Security Advisory draft:

1. Go to the repository `Security` tab.
2. Select `Report a vulnerability`.
3. Include reproduction details, impact, and suggested remediation.

If GitHub Security Advisories are unavailable in your context, open a private channel with repository maintainers and include the same details.
