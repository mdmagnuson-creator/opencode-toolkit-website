# yo, go Brand Voice Framework

> The canonical reference for all user-facing copy across the opencode toolkit website.

---

## Brand Name Usage

**Always lowercase in user-facing contexts:**
- yo, go
- yo
- go

The comma is part of the brand. It's a breath, a beat, a handoff.

**Technical/code contexts may use casing as appropriate** (e.g., variable names, CLI commands).

## The yo, go Concept

### What "yo" represents
- A greeting to your agent
- Expressing intent naturally
- The moment of articulation
- You, speaking your mind

### What "go" represents
- The agent taking action
- Execution happening
- Work flowing forward
- Momentum, not waiting

**Together:** You speak, work flows. Intent becomes action. That's yo, go.

---

## Tone

**Balanced playful + technical clarity**

We're building serious tools for serious developers, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. The tone should feel like a smart colleague who's genuinely excited about what they've built—confident without being arrogant, clear without being dry.

- Playful, not silly
- Technical, not jargon-heavy
- Confident, not boastful
- Clear, not verbose

---

## Voice Principles

### 1. Implicit Concept Framing (Not Imperative Commands)

Frame ideas as states of being, not instructions. Let the reader discover capabilities rather than being told what to do.

### 2. Show the Experience, Don't Dictate Steps

Describe what happens, what it feels like, what becomes possible—not "Step 1: Do this."

### 3. Trust the Reader

Developers are smart. Don't over-explain. Let concepts land.

### 4. Active Voice, Present Tense

Things happen. Work flows. Agents act. Keep it immediate.
