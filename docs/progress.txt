## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 16 with static export configured (output: 'export' in next.config.ts)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @import "tailwindcss" in globals.css
- Dark mode uses class strategy: `.dark` class on html element
- Theme script in layout.tsx for flash-free dark mode on initial load
- Use neutral color palette for minimal design aesthetic
- Geist font family loaded via next/font/google

## 2026-02-19 - US-001: Hero Section

### What was implemented
- Scaffolded Next.js 15+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint, App Router
- Configured static export in next.config.ts (output: 'export', trailingSlash: true)
- Created Hero Section with:
  - Open Source badge
  - Headline: "An Agent System for opencode"
  - Subheadline: "57 specialized agents working together to build software"
  - Primary CTA linking to #getting-started
  - Secondary CTA with GitHub icon (placeholder # link)
  - Stats row: 57 Agents, 16 Skills, 4 Primary Agents
- Dark mode support via class strategy with system preference detection
- Smooth color transitions between light/dark mode

### Files changed
- next.config.ts - Added static export configuration
- src/app/globals.css - Updated for dark mode class strategy
- src/app/layout.tsx - Added metadata, dark mode script, body classes
- src/app/page.tsx - Created Hero Section component

### Learnings for future iterations
- Tailwind v4 uses @import "tailwindcss" not @tailwind directives
- Dark mode class strategy requires script in <head> to prevent flash
- Use suppressHydrationWarning on html element when injecting client scripts
- Static export creates 'out/' directory with index.html

## 2026-02-20 - US-003: Document Unit Test Specialists

### What was implemented
- Added new "Unit Test Specialists" section to testing concepts page
- Created detailed agent cards for each specialist:
  - jest-tester: Backend JS/TS testing with Jest
  - react-tester: React component testing with RTL + Jest
  - go-tester: Go testing with testify and httptest
- Each card includes:
  - Agent name and description
  - File patterns handled (*.ts, *.js, *.tsx, *.jsx, *.go)
  - Testing framework used
  - Key capabilities (6 per agent)
  - Link to full agent documentation page
- Added Project-Specific Overrides section explaining:
  - How to override global testers with project versions
  - Directory structure example (docs/agents/)
  - Common use cases for customization
  - Override priority note

### Files changed
- src/app/concepts/testing/page.tsx - Added Unit Test Specialists section (~500 lines)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Agent cards should use semantic color coding (blue for jest, purple for react, cyan for go)
- Project override documentation should include concrete file path examples
- Capabilities lists work well in 2-column grids on larger screens
