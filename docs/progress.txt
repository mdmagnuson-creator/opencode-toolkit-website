## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 16 with static export configured (output: 'export' in next.config.ts)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @import "tailwindcss" in globals.css
- Dark mode uses class strategy: `.dark` class on html element
- Theme script in layout.tsx for flash-free dark mode on initial load
- Use neutral color palette for minimal design aesthetic
- Geist font family loaded via next/font/google

## 2026-02-19 - US-001: Hero Section

### What was implemented
- Scaffolded Next.js 15+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint, App Router
- Configured static export in next.config.ts (output: 'export', trailingSlash: true)
- Created Hero Section with:
  - Open Source badge
  - Headline: "An Agent System for opencode"
  - Subheadline: "57 specialized agents working together to build software"
  - Primary CTA linking to #getting-started
  - Secondary CTA with GitHub icon (placeholder # link)
  - Stats row: 57 Agents, 16 Skills, 4 Primary Agents
- Dark mode support via class strategy with system preference detection
- Smooth color transitions between light/dark mode

### Files changed
- next.config.ts - Added static export configuration
- src/app/globals.css - Updated for dark mode class strategy
- src/app/layout.tsx - Added metadata, dark mode script, body classes
- src/app/page.tsx - Created Hero Section component

### Learnings for future iterations
- Tailwind v4 uses @import "tailwindcss" not @tailwind directives
- Dark mode class strategy requires script in <head> to prevent flash
- Use suppressHydrationWarning on html element when injecting client scripts
- Static export creates 'out/' directory with index.html

## 2026-02-20 - US-004: Document E2E Testing Agents

### What was implemented
- Added comprehensive "E2E Testing System" section to testing concepts page
- Created E2E workflow diagram showing the complete flow:
  - UI Changes → e2e-reviewer (analyzes) → e2e-areas.json → e2e-playwright (writes) → e2e-tester (runs)
  - Shows pass/fail outcomes (Ready to ship vs Draft PRD created)
- Created detailed agent cards for all 4 E2E agents:
  - e2e-reviewer: Test gap analyzer with amber color theme
  - e2e-playwright: E2E test writer with purple color theme
  - playwright-dev: Playwright automation specialist with indigo color theme
  - e2e-tester: E2E suite runner with green color theme
- Each card includes:
  - Agent name and description
  - Primary output/framework info
  - Key capabilities (6 per agent)
  - Link to full agent documentation page
- Added Key Concepts section explaining:
  - The e2e-areas.json manifest with JSON example
  - How failures become draft PRDs (visual flow diagram)
  - Using the dev server for E2E tests with project.json example

### Files changed
- src/app/concepts/testing/page.tsx - Added E2E Testing System section (~600 lines)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Use distinct color themes for each E2E agent (amber, purple, indigo, green)
- Workflow diagrams with numbered steps are effective for explaining agent chains
- Include JSON code examples in Key Concepts for concrete understanding
- Visual flow diagrams (A → B → C) help explain failure handling workflows

## 2026-02-20 - US-005: Document QA Adversarial Testing System

### What was implemented
- Added comprehensive "QA & Adversarial Testing" section to testing concepts page
- Created QA workflow diagram showing the complete flow:
  - qa (coordinates) → qa-explorer (explores) → Bug Findings → qa-browser-tester (converts) → Regression Tests
  - Shows browser-use CLI as the autonomous browsing tool
- Created detailed agent cards for all 3 QA agents:
  - qa: QA Coordinator with orange color theme
  - qa-explorer: Adversarial Testing Agent with red color theme
  - qa-browser-tester: Bug-to-Test Converter with teal color theme
- Each card includes:
  - Agent name and description
  - Input/output information
  - Key capabilities (6 per agent)
  - Link to full agent documentation page
- Added Browser-Use CLI callout explaining:
  - What browser-use is (external tool for AI-controlled browsing)
  - Required dependency for qa-explorer
  - Real browser control, AI-driven exploration, and beyond scripted tests
  - Link to browser-use documentation
- Added "Why Adversarial Testing?" section with three benefit cards:
  - Finds Edge Cases
  - Simulates Real Users
  - Permanent Protection (bugs become regression tests)

### Files changed
- src/app/concepts/testing/page.tsx - Added QA & Adversarial Testing section (~650 lines)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Use distinct color themes for QA agents (orange for coordinator, red for explorer, teal for browser-tester)
- External dependencies should be prominently documented with callout boxes
- Violet/purple theme works well for external tools like browser-use CLI
- "Why" sections with benefit cards help explain the value proposition of testing approaches

## 2026-02-20 - US-003: Document Unit Test Specialists

### What was implemented
- Added new "Unit Test Specialists" section to testing concepts page
- Created detailed agent cards for each specialist:
  - jest-tester: Backend JS/TS testing with Jest
  - react-tester: React component testing with RTL + Jest
  - go-tester: Go testing with testify and httptest
- Each card includes:
  - Agent name and description
  - File patterns handled (*.ts, *.js, *.tsx, *.jsx, *.go)
  - Testing framework used
  - Key capabilities (6 per agent)
  - Link to full agent documentation page
- Added Project-Specific Overrides section explaining:
  - How to override global testers with project versions
  - Directory structure example (docs/agents/)
  - Common use cases for customization
  - Override priority note

### Files changed
- src/app/concepts/testing/page.tsx - Added Unit Test Specialists section (~500 lines)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Agent cards should use semantic color coding (blue for jest, purple for react, cyan for go)
- Project override documentation should include concrete file path examples
- Capabilities lists work well in 2-column grids on larger screens

## 2026-02-20 - US-006: Document E2E Quality Patterns Skill

### What was implemented
- Added comprehensive "E2E Quality Patterns" section to testing concepts page
- Documented all 7 quality patterns with code examples:
  - assertNeverAppears: Verify elements never flash/flicker during actions
  - withPerformanceBudget: Enforce time/memory constraints as assertions
  - assertNoLayoutShift: Track element positions before/after actions
  - assertStableRender: Monitor content stability over time
  - measureCLS: Measure Cumulative Layout Shift via Performance Observer
  - assertStateStability: Verify desired states don't regress
  - expectMutualExclusivity: Assert UI states never coexist
- Added "When to Use Quality Patterns" guidance box
  - Lists quality pattern use cases (loading states, drag-drop, animations)
  - Lists when basic assertions suffice (form validation, navigation, CRUD)
- Added link to full e2e-quality skill documentation page
- Used pink color theme to distinguish from other testing sections
- All patterns include "Use when:" guidance notes

### Files changed
- src/app/concepts/testing/page.tsx - Added E2E Quality Patterns section (~460 lines)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Pink color theme works well for quality/polish patterns (not used elsewhere)
- Code examples should show realistic use cases, not toy examples
- Each pattern benefits from a specific "Use when:" note
- Link components should use Next.js <Link> not <a> for internal navigation

## 2026-02-20 - US-008: Add Mutation Testing Requirements Concept

### What was implemented
- Added comprehensive "Mutation Testing Pattern" section to testing concepts page
- Documented the 3-stage verification approach for state-changing operations:
  1. **Immediate State**: Assert right after action (catches validation errors, action handler bugs)
  2. **Stable State**: Assert after async operations settle (catches race conditions, optimistic UI mismatches)
  3. **Persistence**: Assert after page reload/re-fetch (catches persistence bugs, cache issues, serialization)
- Created visual cards for each verification stage with:
  - Icon, title, and description
  - What it catches (common bugs)
  - Code snippet showing the assertion pattern
- Added full Playwright code example showing all three stages together
- Added "Why Each Stage Matters" section explaining what bugs each stage catches
- Added additional code examples for delete and create operations
- Added "When to Apply" callout with use case tags (CRUD, form submissions, settings, workflow transitions)
- Used sky/cyan color theme to distinguish from other sections (pink for quality, purple for E2E, orange for QA, blue for unit)

### Files changed
- src/app/concepts/testing/page.tsx - Added Mutation Testing Pattern section (~340 lines)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Sky/cyan color theme available for new testing sections
- Visual stage cards with code snippets help explain multi-step patterns
- "When to Apply" sections with tags help users quickly identify relevant use cases
- The 3-stage pattern is particularly important for E2E tests that verify state changes
