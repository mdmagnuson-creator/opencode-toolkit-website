# PRD: Getting Started Page Rewrite

## Introduction

The current Getting Started page is inaccurate and incomplete. It directs users to download a desktop app that is not part of the setup flow, skips provider/API key configuration entirely, and provides no guidance on how to actually open and talk to an agent. Users — especially those with no coding background — are left with gaps they cannot fill.

This PRD rewrites the Getting Started page from scratch around the correct, complete, terminal-based workflow: install opencode via the command line, connect GitHub Copilot as the provider, install the yo, go toolkit, navigate to a project directory, launch opencode, and start chatting with an agent. Every step must be copyable and self-contained with no gaps.

The page also introduces a persistent step-tracker sidebar so users always know where they are in the overall process while they scroll.

## Goals

- Replace the current page with a fully accurate, step-by-step guide using the terminal-only flow
- Remove all references to downloading a desktop app
- Recommend GitHub Copilot Pro+ as the provider with exact setup steps
- Cover the complete journey: install → connect provider → install toolkit → navigate to project → launch opencode → invoke an agent
- Make every step copyable with zero assumed knowledge (no jargon without explanation)
- Introduce a sticky step-tracker that shows users where they are as they scroll

## User Stories

### US-001: Rewrite the top-level install step

**Description:** As a user coming to this page for the first time, I want clear, copyable instructions for installing opencode in my terminal so I can get it running without any guesswork.

**Background:** The current Step 1 says "Download OpenCode" and links to `opencode.ai/download`. This is wrong — opencode is installed via the terminal using a curl install script. The download page is for a separate desktop product. The correct install command is:
```
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Step 1 is titled "Install opencode"
- [ ] Step 1 shows the curl install command in a copyable code block (using the existing `CopyButton` component)
- [ ] A brief plain-language note explains what this command does: "This downloads and installs opencode — a terminal-based AI coding tool — onto your computer"
- [ ] A secondary note covers macOS users who may need to open a new terminal window after install for the `opencode` command to be available
- [ ] No mention of downloading a desktop app anywhere on the page
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

### US-002: Add provider setup step (GitHub Copilot)

**Description:** As a new user, I want clear instructions for connecting a provider so opencode can actually talk to an AI model.

**Background:** The current page skips provider setup entirely, which means users hit an error the first time they run opencode. GitHub Copilot Pro+ ($19/month) is the recommended starting provider because it provides access to top models (including Claude Sonnet) via a subscription rather than per-token billing. The setup uses opencode's built-in `/connect` command inside the TUI, then an OAuth device flow.

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Step 2 is titled "Connect a provider"
- [ ] The step recommends GitHub Copilot Pro+ with a direct link to `https://github.com/features/copilot/plans`
- [ ] Plain-language explanation: "A provider is the AI service that powers opencode. Think of it like connecting opencode to a brain."
- [ ] Instructions tell the user to first launch opencode in their terminal: run `opencode` (with copyable code block)
- [ ] Instructions show the exact `/connect` command to type inside opencode (copyable)
- [ ] A rendered terminal-style UI mockup shows what the provider selection prompt looks like, with "GitHub Copilot" highlighted
- [ ] Instructions explain the device auth step: opencode will display a URL and a code; go to `github.com/login/device`, enter the code, and authorize
- [ ] A rendered terminal-style UI mockup shows the device auth prompt (URL + code + "Waiting for authorization...")
- [ ] Instructions note: after connecting, type `/models` to verify models are available, then `/exit` to quit opencode
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

### US-003: Add yo, go toolkit install step

**Description:** As a user who now has opencode running, I want clear instructions to install the yo, go agent toolkit so the agents (Planner, Builder, etc.) are available.

**Background:** The toolkit install step exists on the current page but is buried as Step 3, after the (wrong) desktop download and (skipped) provider steps. It should be its own clear step with the curl command. The install command is generated by `getInstallCommand()` from `src/config/urls.ts`.

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Step 3 is titled "Install the yo, go toolkit"
- [ ] Plain-language explanation: "This installs the agents, skills, and project templates that make opencode work for structured software development"
- [ ] The install command is shown in a copyable code block using `getInstallCommand()`
- [ ] A note explains what gets installed and where: agents, skills, and scaffolds go into `~/.config/opencode/`
- [ ] The existing interactive-install note is preserved (about `/dev/tty` and CI environments defaulting to `n`)
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

### US-004: Add "navigate to your project" step

**Description:** As a user ready to start coding, I need a step that tells me to navigate to my project directory before launching opencode, because opencode runs in the context of whatever directory I'm in.

**Background:** The current page has no "navigate to your project" step at all. opencode must be launched from within your project directory — it uses the working directory as context. This is a gap that stops users cold, especially those without CLI experience.

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Step 4 is titled "Go to your project folder"
- [ ] Plain-language explanation: "opencode works inside your project. You need to point your terminal at the folder you want to work on."
- [ ] Shows a copyable `cd` command example: `cd path/to/your-project` (with a note that the user should replace this with their actual folder path)
- [ ] For users who don't have a project yet: a callout note says "Starting from scratch? You can also create a new project — the Planner agent will walk you through it. Just navigate to any empty folder: `mkdir my-project && cd my-project`" — shown as a copyable compound command
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

### US-005: Add "launch opencode and start an agent" step

**Description:** As a user in my project directory, I want exact instructions for launching opencode and starting a conversation with an agent, including what to type.

**Background:** The current page mentions pressing `Tab` to open an "agent selector" — but the correct flow is to launch `opencode` in the terminal (which opens the TUI), and then invoke an agent by typing `@planner`, `@builder`, etc. directly in the chat prompt. Agents are invoked by name with the `@` prefix.

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Step 5 is titled "Launch opencode"
- [ ] Shows the `opencode` launch command in a copyable code block
- [ ] A rendered terminal-style mockup shows the opencode TUI prompt after launch
- [ ] Explains that agents are invoked by typing their name with `@` in the prompt, e.g. `@planner` or `@builder`
- [ ] Shows three practical starter prompts users can try, each in a copyable format:
  - `@planner` — "Start here if you're building something new. Planner will help you define what to build."
  - `@builder` — "Start here if you have a task ready and want to start writing code."
  - `@coder` — "Start here for quick, interactive coding help without a formal project setup."
- [ ] A note explains what happens next: the agent will immediately ask you to select or register a project
- [ ] Shows the project selection prompt mockup (same as currently on the page)
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

### US-006: Implement sticky step-tracker sidebar

**Description:** As a user following a multi-step guide, I want a persistent sidebar or progress indicator that shows all steps and highlights which step is currently visible on screen, so I always know where I am in the process without scrolling back to the top.

**Background:** The guide will have 5 steps that span significant vertical scroll distance. Users — especially those following along in a terminal while reading — lose their place easily. A sticky "steps" rail on the left (or right) that highlights the active step as you scroll is a well-established UX pattern for long setup guides (e.g., Stripe docs, Vercel docs).

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] On desktop (md+ breakpoint), a sticky sidebar shows all steps as a vertical list with numbers and titles:
  - 1. Install opencode
  - 2. Connect a provider
  - 3. Install the toolkit
  - 4. Go to your project folder
  - 5. Launch opencode
- [ ] The active step is visually highlighted (e.g., bold text, colored left border, or filled step circle) using Intersection Observer to detect which step is currently in view
- [ ] Completed steps (above the current viewport) show a distinct "done" visual state (e.g., muted text with a checkmark or strikethrough — no filled circle to avoid making it feel interactive)
- [ ] Clicking a step in the sidebar scrolls to that step on the page
- [ ] On mobile (below md breakpoint), the sidebar is hidden; instead, a compact "Step X of 5" pill appears fixed at the top or bottom of the screen
- [ ] The step-tracker uses the existing design system (Tailwind classes, dark mode aware)
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser — confirm step highlighting updates correctly as the user scrolls in both light and dark mode

### US-007: Retain and clean up post-setup content

**Description:** As a user who has completed setup, I want the "Starting Your First Project", "Project Structure", "Key Agents to Know", and "Learn More" sections to remain on the page but be cleaned up and repositioned as a natural continuation after the 5 install steps.

**Background:** The current page has good content in these sections but it's all intermixed with the wrong install steps. These sections should stay, cleaned up:
- "Starting Your First Project" — keep, but remove the now-redundant "open opencode and select a primary agent" sub-step (covered in US-005)
- "Project Structure After Setup" — keep as-is
- "Key Agents to Know" — keep; the `@e2e-tester` fix is covered by `prd-accuracy-fixes` but verify that fix is applied before this PRD ships, or apply it here
- "Learn More" — keep as-is

**Documentation:** No

**Tools:** No

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] A visual divider and section heading ("After Setup") separates the 5 install steps from the post-setup content
- [ ] "Starting Your First Project" removes the first sub-step ("Open opencode and select a primary agent") since that's now covered in Step 5
- [ ] The remaining sub-steps in "Starting Your First Project" are renumbered correctly
- [ ] "Project Structure After Setup" is unchanged
- [ ] "Key Agents to Know" does not reference `@e2e-tester` (should reference `@e2e-reviewer`)
- [ ] "Learn More" section is unchanged
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: Every step must include at least one copyable command block — no step is prose-only
- FR-2: No mention of "Download OpenCode" or `opencode.ai/download` anywhere on the page
- FR-3: The GitHub Copilot Pro+ recommendation must link to `https://github.com/features/copilot/plans`
- FR-4: The `/connect` and `/models` commands shown in Step 2 must be displayed as they appear in the opencode TUI (i.e., slash-prefixed text in a terminal-style block) — not as bash commands
- FR-5: The sticky step-tracker must use `IntersectionObserver` — no scroll event listeners for performance reasons
- FR-6: The page must render correctly on mobile (step-tracker collapses to a pill indicator)
- FR-7: All terminal-style mockups must be visually consistent — same dark background code block style currently used on the page

## Non-Goals

- No changes to the opencode install script itself
- No changes to other pages (accuracy fixes for `@e2e-tester` are tracked in `prd-accuracy-fixes`)
- No new provider documentation beyond the GitHub Copilot setup steps
- No video or animated content
- No changes to the Header, Footer, or site navigation

## Technical Considerations

- The sticky step-tracker sidebar will require a new client component (`StepTracker`) since it uses `IntersectionObserver` — the rest of the page can remain a Server Component
- Each step section needs an `id` attribute for the tracker to target (e.g., `id="step-install"`, `id="step-provider"`, etc.) and for sidebar click-to-scroll
- The `getInstallCommand()` function from `src/config/urls.ts` should continue to be used for the toolkit install command in Step 3 — do not hardcode the URL
- Terminal-style UI mockups for the opencode TUI (provider selection prompt, device auth prompt, TUI chat prompt) should use the same `<pre>` + dark `rounded-lg bg-neutral-900` styling currently used for the project selection prompt mockup
- The mobile "Step X of 5" pill should be a fixed-position element that updates via the same IntersectionObserver used by the sidebar
- Page layout will change from single-column to a two-column layout on desktop (sidebar + main content) — use CSS Grid with something like `grid-cols-[200px_1fr]` or `grid-cols-[220px_1fr]` at the `md` breakpoint

## Credential & Service Access Plan

No external credentials required for this PRD. The GitHub Copilot device auth flow is demonstrated via UI mockups only — no actual API calls are made from the website.

## Definition of Done

Implementation is complete when:

1. All seven user stories pass their acceptance criteria
2. The page follows the complete, correct flow: install opencode → connect GitHub Copilot → install toolkit → navigate to project → launch opencode and invoke an agent
3. Zero mentions of "Download OpenCode" or the desktop app remain on the page
4. Every step has at least one copyable command
5. The sticky step-tracker highlights the correct step as the user scrolls, on desktop
6. A "Step X of 5" pill is visible on mobile as the user scrolls through steps
7. All terminal UI mockups are visually consistent
8. The post-setup sections ("Starting Your First Project", "Project Structure", "Key Agents to Know", "Learn More") are present and cleaned up
9. Lint, typecheck, and build all pass
10. Manual browser verification in both light and dark mode, on desktop and mobile viewport widths
